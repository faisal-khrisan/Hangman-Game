# Hangman-Game
This Python app  implements a classic game of Hangman. The game selects a random word from a predefined list (hangman_words.word_list) and prompts the player to guess letters one at a time. The player has 6 lives, and each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives remaining. The game provides visual feedback using ASCII art stages (hangman_art.stages) to represent the hangman's progress.
# Features:
* Random Word Selection: The game randomly picks a word from a list of predefined words.

* Visual Feedback: The game displays the current state of the word with underscores representing unguessed letters and updates the display as the player guesses correctly.

* ives System: The player starts with 6 lives. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives, and the game ends when the player runs out of lives.

* Duplicate Guess Prevention: The game prevents the player from guessing the same letter more than once.

# How to Play:
1- Run the script.

2- The game will display the Hangman logo and the word to guess in the form of underscores (e.g., _ _ _ _).

3- Enter a letter to guess.

4- The game will update the display to show correctly guessed letters and inform you if the guess was incorrect.

5- Continue guessing until you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
